## 📂 Dataset

Input (X):

| x1 | x2 |
|----|----|
| 0  | 0  |
| 0  | 1  |
| 1  | 0  |
| 1  | 1  |

Output (y):

| x1 | x2 | Output |
|----|----|--------|
| 0  | 0  | 0      |
| 0  | 1  | 0      |
| 1  | 0  | 0      |
| 1  | 1  | 1      |

This represents the AND logic gate.

## Output
    Weights: [[0.2 0.2]]
    Bias: [-0.2]
    Predictions: [0 0 0 1]

- w₁, w₂ → we
